<h3>8.1 Google Analytics</h3>

<p>According to Google, Google will use the information obtained to evaluate your use of the website, to compile reports on website activity and to provide us with other services related to website and internet use. The IP address transmitted by your browser as part of Google Analytics will not be merged with other Google data. Google may, however, transfer this information to third parties where required to do so by law, or where such third parties process the information on Google&#8217;s behalf. You can prevent the storage of cookies by setting your browser software accordingly. However, we would like to point out that in this case you may not be able to use all the functions of the website to their full extent.

<h3>8.2 Google Doubleclick</h3>
<p>The website uses the online marketing tool DoubleClick. To help AdWords customers and publishers serve and manage ads on the web, the Google advertising network and certain Google services may be used. DoubleClick uses cookies to serve ads that are relevant to users, to improve campaign performance reports, or to prevent a user from seeing the same ads more than once. Google uses a cookie ID to record which ads are shown in which browser and can thus prevent them from being shown more than once. In addition, DoubleClick can use cookie IDs to record so-called conversions that are related to ad requests. This is the case, for example, when a user sees a DoubleClick ad and later calls up the advertiser&#8217;s website with the same browser and buys something there. According to Google, DoubleClick cookies do not contain any personal information. Due to the marketing tools used, your browser automatically establishes a direct connection with Google&#8217;s server. We have no influence on the scope and further use of the data collected by Google using this tool and therefore inform you according to our state of knowledge: Through the integration of DoubleClick, Google receives the information that you have called up the corresponding part of our website or clicked on an advertisement from us. If you are registered with a Google service, Google can assign the visit to your account. Even if you are not registered with Google or have not logged in, it is possible that the provider may obtain and store your IP address.</p>

The aim is to ensure that our Facebook ads correspond to user interest and do not have a harassing effect. On the other hand, we can use pixels to track the effectiveness of Facebook ads for statistical and market research purposes by seeing whether users were redirected to our website after clicking on a Facebook ad (so-called &#8220;conversion&#8221;).</p>
